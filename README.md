The project title is a level 1 heading (`<h1>Project Title</h1>` or `# Project Title`).

If your project has a name, then this is where it would go.

If your project does not have a name, you can use this space to explain the project. For example, code repositories of research papers usually have the paper title here.

You can also add your branding in a cover image. It makes the README unique and gets people's attention quickly.

Wait, I forgot something. You can use this README as a template from [this link](README-template.md).

I usually prefer the dimensions 1280Ã—650. It has worked well for me so far. I can also reuse it as my social preview image for the repo.

Below the title, you will see some badges. These can be used to show the status of the project.

The badges used here were generated with [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

You can add a workflow status badge to indicate the status of your workflows in your README. This can used to answer questions like, `is the build working?` or `are the e2e tests passing?`.

The badges used here are explained below:
